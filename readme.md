# FRED - FHIR Resource Editor

## What is FRED?
FRED is an open source web application that enables users to edit JSON [FHIR resources](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/resourcelist.html) and [FHIR bundles](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/bundle.html). Built as an HTML5 app, FRED runs entirely within your web browser - no data is sent to a server. *Note - the project is currently under active development. Code is rough, there are bugs and features may change or be removed!*
